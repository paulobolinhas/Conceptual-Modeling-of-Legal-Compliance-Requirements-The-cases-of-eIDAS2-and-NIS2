ArchiMate Architecture Descriptions of eIDAS2 and NIS2

## Abstract

This work explores the hypothesis that conceptual models can simplify the understanding of complex legal compliance requirements. There is a recognized absence of complete and well-defined models for eIDAS2 (Electronic Identification, Authentication, and Trust Services) and NIS2 (Network and Information Systems), two critical European legislations addressing digital identity and cybersecurity, respectively. Through conceptual modelling, this research fills these gaps by developing two detailed architecture descriptions, aiming to improve eIDAS2 and NIS2 legal clarity and observance. ArchiMate is used as the modelling language since it provides a structured enterprise architecture framework that visually represents legal requisites. The final architecture descriptions include multiple documented views offering insights for entities seeking to understand and comply with these legislations, along with practical examples demonstrating their real-world application. Furthermore, work with Artificial Intelligence is explored for validation and documentation of these views within ArchiMate.<img width="468" height="159" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bb73c335-6569-499e-8318-2b8c9f9870b5" />
